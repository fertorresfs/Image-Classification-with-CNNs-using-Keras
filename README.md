Now, we will build a CNN model and train it to solve an image classification problem. In this hands on project, you will go through the following tasks:

Importing Libraries
Processing the Data
Visualize Examples
Create Model
Train the Model
Final Predictions
While you are watching the instructions, you will get a cloud desktop with all the required software pre-installed and you will be able to follow along the instructions to complete the above mentioned tasks.

Project-Based Course Overview
Welcome to Image Classification with CNNs using Keras. This is a project-based course which should take little over 1 hour to finish. Before diving into the project, please take a look at the course objectives and structure:

Course Objectives
In this course, we are going to focus on two learning objectives:

Understand how to create convolutional neural networks in Keras.
Be able to train convolutional neural networks to solve image classification problems.
By the end of this course, you will be able to create a CNN model in Keras from scratch, and use to solve image classification problems on your own data.

Course Structure
This course is divided into 3 parts:

Course Overview: This introductory reading material.
Image Classification with CNNs using Keras Project: This is the hands on project that we will work on in Rhyme.
Graded Quiz: This is the final assignment that will test your understanding of the project. You need to pass in order to finish the course successfully.
Project Structure
The hands on project on Image Classification with CNNs using Keras is divided into following tasks:

Task 1: Introduction
Introduction to the problem.
Introduction to the Rhyme interface.
Importing the required libraries and helper functions.
Task 2: Pre-process Data
Importing the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Creating a subset of the dataset which has just 3 classes instead of 10. This is done for both the training and test set.
Randomly shuffling the newly created subset.
Task 3: Visualize Examples
Plotting randomly selected examples of a given set.
We look at some examples from training and test set along with their labels.
Task 4: Create Model
Creating a Keras Sequential model.
Creating a function to add a convolutional block to the model.
A look at the model summary.
Task 5: Train the Model
Fit the model on the subset.
Setting the EarlyStopping callback.
Setting the ModelCheckpoint callback.
Task 6: Final Predictions
Plotting the training and validation accuracy from the training.
Loading the best model.
Getting predictions on the test set and displaying the results.

About Rhyme
This course runs on Coursera's hands-on platform called Rhyme. On Rhyme, you do projects in a hands-on manner in your browser. You will get instant access to pre-configured cloud desktops that have all the software and data you will need. So, you can just focus on the learning. For this project, this means instant access to a cloud desktop with Python, Jupyter, and TensorFlow pre-installed.

Earn a Certificate
After you have completed the Image Classification with CNNs using Keras hands-on project, you will be able to assess your knowledge using an ungraded assignment. Once you are comfortable with the concepts, take the final quiz, score higher than 80% to earn your certificate.
